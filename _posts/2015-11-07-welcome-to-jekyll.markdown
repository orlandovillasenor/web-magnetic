Web Magnetic has launched a new website! The site was built using Jekyll which is an awesome static site generator that gives you the option to incorporate blog posts into your site without using a database. You can check out Jekyll [here][jekyll] but here is how you get Jekyll up and running quickly.

Install Jekyll by going into your terminal app and running these commands:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
sudo gem install jekyll
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

The great thing about running the 'jekyll serve' command is that it boots up a server for you at port 4000 so you can open up http://localhost:4000 in your browser and you will see your new Jekyll intalled website with some sample pages and blog posts.
